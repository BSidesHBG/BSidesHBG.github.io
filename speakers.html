								<h4>Presentation: Building an Awesome Governance Program </h4>
								<h5>
									Abstract: Let's face it - running a security governance program is challenging. With the continuing pressure of keeping our information secure and breach-free while management doesn't see the need to increase the budget if there isn't an incident occurring or compliance need. So how does someone in the trenches measure, monitor, and communicate this to ensure that you get the buy-in needed - or at least get the acceptance from management on the risk? It's something that everyone in a security leadership position struggles to address appropriately. Through this talk, we will discuss some critical points in implementing, managing, and creating oversight to communicate internally to the security team and externally with the company. And don't worry, the topics we discuss will apply across the board - from small businesses to Fortune 100.

								<h4>Presentation: DIY Malware: All my base are belong to me! </h4>
								<h5>
									Abstract: "If it's not tested, it's broken." How often do you test your network security? How much does it cost you? When pentesting is done right, it's fabulous. If you're not careful, however, the results can be high-cost and low-value. Furthermore, if pentests are performed infrequently, it's hard to know if your team and tools are really up to the challenge of defending your network. In this talk, we'll discuss adversary emulation and how it can augment your red and blue team activities.

								<h4>Presentation: Give Yourself a Brand</h4>
								<h5>
									Abstract: The cybersecurity community, while numbering in the millions, is actually very “small” when it comes to reputations. Having met thousands of brilliant technicians and leaders throughout my 20 year career in tech, I know that these professionals are great at what they do. The challenge for them, and the business problem that I love to help solve, is that they don't understand what - or even often, why - I do what I do. That is to create stories.
